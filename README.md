SplashScreen.dart
```

Assets and fonts are configured in `pubspec.yaml`:

- Assets: `assets/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/pay/`
- Fonts: Jost (Regular, Bold)

## Development Setup

### Environment Requirements

```plaintext
Flutter SDK: ≥3.9.0 (stable channel)
Dart SDK: ≥3.9.0
IDE: VS Code or Android Studio (recommended)
```

### Development Environment Validation

```bash
# Verify Flutter installation
flutter doctor -v

# Verify Flutter version
flutter --version

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
```

### Application Launch

```bash
# Android Development
flutter run -d android --flavor development

# iOS Development (requires macOS)
flutter run -d ios --flavor development

# Web Development
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer canvaskit
```

### Development Tools

Enable DevicePreview for responsive development:

```dart
// DevicePreview(enabled: !kReleaseMode, builder: (context) => MyApp()),
```

## Configuration

- Theming: managed in `lib/core/theme.dart` (light/dark, colors, typography)
- Payments:
  - PayPal and credit card flows rely on community packages. If credentials or environment values are required, configure them in the payment screens (e.g., `lib/Ui/screens/payment/`) as per the package documentation.
- Assets & Fonts: declared in `pubspec.yaml`; ensure paths remain in sync if assets move.

## Build and Deployment

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Static Analysis
flutter analyze

# Unit and Widget Tests
flutter test

# Integration Tests
flutter test integration_test
```

### Production Builds

```bash
# Android Production Build
flutter build apk --release --flavor production
flutter build appbundle --release --flavor production

# iOS Production Build (requires macOS)
flutter build ios --release --flavor production
flutter build ipa --release --flavor production

# Web Production Build
flutter build web --release --web-renderer auto
```

### Performance Profiling
```bash
# Run app in profile mode
flutter run --profile

# Generate performance metrics
flutter run --trace-skia
```

## Testing

- Framework: `flutter_test`
- Example: `test/widget_test.dart` contains a basic widget test scaffold
- Guidance:
  - Prefer widget tests for UI components (widgets in `lib/Ui/widgets`)
  - Add integration tests for end‑to‑end user flows (navigation, payments)
  - Keep ProductDataService side‑effects contained for predictable tests

## Design & UX Notes

- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color usage defined in `AppThemes`
- Favor reusable widgets in `lib/Ui/widgets` for product list cards, grids, headers
- Use `IndexedStack` to preserve state between tabs when adding new screens

## App Icons

This project is configured with `flutter_launcher_icons`. To regenerate:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```
